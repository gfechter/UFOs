# UFOs

## Project Overview
A data journalist interested in UFOs asked for assistance to build a webpage that will feature an article, a table of findings to support the article, and a way to filter through the data table. After the initial webpage was built, the data journalist decides that it would be beneficial to add additional filters for users to sort through the data table. The additional requested table filters are city, state, country, and shape. 

## Resources
- Data: data.js
- Visual Studio Code, Javascript, CSS, HTML

## Results
The webpage was updated to include the additional requested table filters. First, the index.html file was updated by removing the "filter" button and adding four more list elements to the file. The list elements that were added were city, state, country, and shape. After the index.html file was updated, the app.js file was updated to update the filters based on user input by creating a new function called "updateFilters()." After this was completed, the filterTable() function was updated to include the updated table data based on user input, and then, the table was rebuilt with the filtered data. The result is users that can filter through the data table to find information about specific UFO sightings. 

Website Before Applying Filters

Filtering the Table

If someone wanted to find all sightings in Oregon, they could input "or" and "us." To filter through the table, a user has to either click on the webpage or hit the enter key on their keyboard.

Filters can also be applied in each filter category (date, city, state, country, and shape).

## Summary
The webpage is well-done and is a very good starting point. However, it could be more user-friendly. One major drawback is it is difficult to tell the scope of data and the table without scrolling through the whole table. Without really knowing the scope of the data table, it could be challenging to know where to begin a search. 

There are a few ways that this page could be updated to be more user-friendly:
- There should be a "filter" button that a user can click on to sort through the data. This would make it easier for users to sort through the data.
- There should be a drop-down menu for each filter so the user can see what dates, cities, states, countries, and shapes they can choose from. 

Even though the webpage is off to a great start, the addition of those recommendations would make the website superb.
